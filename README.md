# Udacity Sensor Fusion Nanodegree Course
This code is part of one of the projects in [Udacity sensor fusion nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/sensor-fusion-engineer-nanodegree--nd313). The goal is to filter, segment, and cluster real point cloud data to detect obstacles in a real-world driving environment. In this project, we processed raw lidar data to detect other vehicles on the road implementing Ransac with planner model fitting to segment point clouds. We also used Eucleadian clustering with KD-tree to cluster and distinguish [vehicles and obsticles](https://www.udacity.com/course/sensor-fusion-engineer-nanodegree--nd313).
<br>
A demo for this repository is shown in below, in which the real-world raw point clouds were processed to the 3D reconstruction of environment.

## Installation 
***
The installation process is the same as one that explained in [Udacity github repository](https://github.com/rayryeng/SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection).
